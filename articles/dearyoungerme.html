                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Dear Younger Me,</p>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">It fills my heart with joy to reflect upon the remarkable journey
                                    we have undertaken as part of the United First Nations. As I write this, in the year
                                    2032, I am overwhelmed with gratitude for the incredible individuals who refused to
                                    let their talents go to waste. We rallied together, petitioned our former
                                    government, formed numerous circles, engaged in extensive rounds of voting, and
                                    eventually achieved our long-awaited independence.</p>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Since our transformation, we have witnessed several positive
                                    changes take root in our society. For one, every citizen now receives a basic income
                                    from the government, a concept akin to a non-mass murder tax credit. This
                                    redistribution of resources has enabled us to create a more equitable society where
                                    everyone can flourish.</p>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">When our values aligned with what is truly beneficial for all,
                                    remarkable progress followed suit. It is awe-inspiring to realize that only in
                                    America could we lead a revolution through peaceful sit-ins. I hold a deep love for
                                    this land and its people, for the United States of America was once a beautiful
                                    dream—one that I never wished to awaken from, unlike others who sadly never departed
                                    from that dream.</p>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">We, the people, achieved the seemingly impossible. We fought
                                    figuratively, just as our revolutionary ancestors did, and now we enjoy the option
                                    of government-sponsored healthcare. From within the broken system, it often appeared
                                    that our goals were unattainable, and at times, all seemed lost. But we shed blood
                                    for this moment, and it was all worth it.</p>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">As I write to you after the completion of my work week, I am in the
                                    midst of a four-day weekend, relishing a day of relaxation. The fears that once
                                    plagued our population have dissipated, and even legislative actions have addressed
                                    our climate concerns, though challenges from fossil fuel and nuclear companies
                                    persist. However, an increasing number of us now prefer to build a future that
                                    benefits all rather than align ourselves with these industries.</p>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">If I could transport you back in time, you would be astounded by
                                    the village-style cities we have created. They surpass your wildest
                                    imagination—sustainable, brimming with life from young to old. Our children can
                                    finally breathe a sigh of relief, knowing that the air they inhale is clean, the
                                    water they drink is pure, and the services we all contribute to are continuously
                                    enhancing the living standards for each successive generation. The rates of
                                    depression and suicide have plummeted, mass shootings have become rare, and you
                                    would be astounded by the incredible increase in life expectancy. Infant mortality
                                    rates have dropped significantly, and for the first time in half a century, income
                                    inequality is rapidly declining.</p>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">When I speak of those Quakers who were once mocked, people now
                                    laugh with me in recognition. They grasp the profound truth that every individual's
                                    light, ideas, and wisdom truly make a difference. Just wait and see the
                                    transformative power that lies within us all.</p>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">With boundless hope and gratitude,</p>
