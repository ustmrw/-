                            <p class="fs-6 mb-4"><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
                            <p class="fs-6 mb-4"><strong>Geopolitical tensions rise as nuclear weapons shape the
                                    competition between NATO and BRICS, posing challenges of nuclear proliferation
                                    and highlighting the need for dialogue and cooperation to address global
                                    security concerns.</strong></p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">The world is witnessing a new era of geopolitical tensions, where
                                nuclear weapons play a central role in the deterrence and defence strategies of
                                major powers. NATO, the transatlantic alliance that has been the cornerstone of
                                European security for decades, faces a growing challenge from BRICS, a group of
                                emerging economies that includes Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa.
                                BRICS is not a formal military alliance, but it represents a potential counterweight
                                to NATO's influence and interests in various regions of the world.</p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">One of the most pressing issues in this context is the problem of
                                nuclear proliferation, which refers to the spread of nuclear weapons and related
                                technologies to countries that do not possess them. Nuclear proliferation poses a
                                serious threat to international peace and security, as it increases the risk of
                                nuclear war, terrorism, accidents and miscalculations. Moreover, it undermines the
                                global efforts to achieve nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation, which are among
                                NATO's core objectives.</p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">NATO has a long-standing policy of nuclear deterrence, which means
                                that it maintains a credible and effective nuclear capability to prevent any
                                aggression or coercion against its members or partners. NATO's nuclear forces are a
                                core component of its overall capabilities for deterrence and defence, alongside
                                conventional and missile defence forces. NATO is committed to arms control,
                                disarmament and non-proliferation, but as long as nuclear weapons exist, it will
                                remain a nuclear alliance.</p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">BRICS, on the other hand, has a more diverse and complex nuclear
                                posture. Among its members, only Russia, India and China possess nuclear weapons,
                                while Brazil and South Africa have renounced them. Russia has the largest nuclear
                                arsenal in the world, with more than 6,000 warheads, according to the Arms Control
                                Association. India and China have much smaller but growing nuclear forces, estimated
                                at around 150 and 350 warheads respectively. Brazil and South Africa have both
                                pursued nuclear weapons programs in the past, but have voluntarily given them up and
                                joined the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), which aims to
                                prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and promote their elimination.</p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">The relationship between NATO and BRICS on nuclear issues is marked
                                by both cooperation and competition. On one hand, they share some common interests
                                and goals, such as preventing nuclear terrorism, enhancing nuclear safety and
                                security, and supporting multilateral initiatives such as the NPT and the
                                Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT). On the other hand, they have divergent
                                views and interests on many aspects of nuclear policy, such as the role of nuclear
                                weapons in national security strategies, the legitimacy and legality of NATO's
                                nuclear sharing arrangements, the balance of power and stability in regions such as
                                Europe and Asia, and the future of global nuclear governance.</p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Some analysts have argued that we are already in a new Cold War or
                                even a World War III, where NATO and BRICS are engaged in a strategic rivalry that
                                could escalate into a nuclear confrontation. Others have suggested that there is
                                still room for dialogue and cooperation between these actors, especially on issues
                                of common concern such as climate change, pandemic response, counter-terrorism and
                                cyber security. In any case, it is clear that the problem of nuclear proliferation
                                remains one of the most urgent and complex challenges for international security in
                                the 21st century.</p>
