                                <section class="mb-5">
                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">The world is witnessing a new era of geopolitical tensions, where nuclear weapons play a central role in the deterrence and defence strategies of major powers. NATO, the transatlantic alliance that has been the cornerstone of European security for decades, faces a growing challenge from BRICS, a group of emerging economies that includes Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa. BRICS is not a formal military alliance, but it represents a potential counterweight to NATO's influence and interests in various regions of the world.</p>
                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">One of the most pressing issues in this context is the problem of nuclear proliferation, which refers to the spread of nuclear weapons and related technologies to countries that do not possess them. Nuclear proliferation poses a serious threat to international peace and security, as it increases the risk of nuclear war, terrorism, accidents and miscalculations. Moreover, it undermines the global efforts to achieve nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation, which are among NATO's core objectives.</p>
                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">NATO has a long-standing policy of nuclear deterrence, which means that it maintains a credible and effective nuclear capability to prevent any aggression or coercion against its members or partners. NATO's nuclear forces are a core component of its overall capabilities for deterrence and defence, alongside conventional and missile defence forces. NATO is committed to arms control, disarmament and non-proliferation, but as long as nuclear weapons exist, it will remain a nuclear alliance.</p>
                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">BRICS, on the other hand, has a more diverse and complex nuclear posture. Among its members, only Russia, India and China possess nuclear weapons, while Brazil and South Africa have renounced them. Russia has the largest nuclear arsenal in the world, with more than 6,000 warheads, according to the Arms Control Association. India and China have much smaller but growing nuclear forces, estimated at around 150 and 350 warheads respectively. Brazil and South Africa have both pursued nuclear weapons programs in the past, but have voluntarily given them up and joined the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), which aims to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and promote their elimination.</p>
                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">The relationship between NATO and BRICS on nuclear issues is marked by both cooperation and competition. On one hand, they share some common interests and goals, such as preventing nuclear terrorism, enhancing nuclear safety and security, and supporting multilateral initiatives such as the NPT and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT). On the other hand, they have divergent views and interests on many aspects of nuclear policy, such as the role of nuclear weapons in national security strategies, the legitimacy and legality of NATO's nuclear sharing arrangements, the balance of power and stability in regions such as Europe and Asia, and the future of global nuclear governance.</p>
                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Some analysts have argued that we are already in a new Cold War or even a World War III, where NATO and BRICS are engaged in a strategic rivalry that could escalate into a nuclear confrontation. Others have suggested that there is still room for dialogue and cooperation between these actors, especially on issues of common concern such as climate change, pandemic response, counter-terrorism and cyber security. In any case, it is clear that the problem of nuclear proliferation remains one of the most urgent and complex challenges for international security in the 21st century.</p>
